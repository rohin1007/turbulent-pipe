# Turbulent Pipe Flow (RANS)

Turbulent flow through a pipe of diameter 0.2m and 3m length modelled using the standard k-e turbulence model. Geometry is axisymmetric. 

A mesh with 3000 elements (100x30) was created. Reynolds number of the flow is 10000. 

The velocity U profile at the outlet shows a fully developed flow. The velocity magnitude increases from zero at the wall to a maximum value at the centreline. Due to this velocity gradient, turbulence is produced. This can be seen in the turbulent kinetic energy/TKE profile at the outlet. The TKE is dissipated as one moves away from the wall.
